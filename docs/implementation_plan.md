# Implementation Plan - Content Pages

I will update the legal and trust pages to be specific to **Picksy.au**, including Australian legal references and marketplace-specific terms.

## Proposed Changes

### [MODIFY] [Privacy Policy](file:///Users/bjm/Desktop/Pick1901/src/app/privacy/page.tsx)
-   Update "Company" to "Picksy Marketplace".
-   Reference the **Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)**.
-   Add specific details about data collection for KYC/Verification (if applicable).

### [MODIFY] [Terms of Service](file:///Users/bjm/Desktop/Pick1901/src/app/terms/page.tsx)
-   Add sections for **Buying & Selling** mechanics.
-   Add **Fees & Payments** section (mentioning AUD).
-   Add **Shipping & Delivery** policy (Australia Post references).
-   Add **Refunds & Returns** policy (Australian Consumer Law compliance).

### [NEW] [Contact Page](file:///Users/bjm/Desktop/Pick1901/src/app/contact/page.tsx)
-   Create a new page with a contact form (or email links).
-   Include "Perth, Western Australia" location context.

### [MODIFY] [DMCA](file:///Users/bjm/Desktop/Pick1901/src/app/dmca/page.tsx)
-   Ensure contact email is correct (`legal@picksy.au`).

## Verification
-   Manual review of each page to ensure content renders correctly and links work.
