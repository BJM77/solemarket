# Picksy Growth Strategy & Outreach

## Outreach Script (Facebook / Gumtree)
*Use this script to manually recruit high-quality sellers from other platforms.*

> "Hi [Name],
> 
> I saw your listing for [Item Name]—it's a great piece!
> 
> I’ve actually just built a dedicated Australian marketplace called **Picksy (picksy.au)** specifically for collectors (Cards, Coins, Memorabilia). We are currently in early access and I'm looking for a few founding sellers to feature.
> 
> It’s **free to list**, and if you’d like, I can even help list your items for you to save you the time. I'd love to feature your items on our homepage to help them get more visibility with the right audience.
> 
> Check us out at picksy.au if you're interested in a more specialized home for your collection.
> 
> Cheers,
> [Your Name]"

## Growth "Growth Loop" Initiatives
1. **The "Concierge" Onboarding**: Manually list items for the first 10 sellers to populate the "Featured" section.
2. **Founding Member Status**: Grant "Verified" status to early adopters to build instant social currency.
3. **Programmatic SEO**: Optimize landing pages for "Pokemon Cards Australia," "NBA Cards Melbourne," etc.
4. **Community Value**: share the "AI Grader" tool in collector groups as a free utility to drive traffic.
