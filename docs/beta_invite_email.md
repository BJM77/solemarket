# Picksy.au Soft Launch Invitation

**Subject:** You're Invited: Be a Founding Seller on Australia's Newest Marketplace

Hi [Name],

We’ve been watching your collection on [Instagram/Facebook] and we’re impressed.

We are **Picksy.au**, a new Australian marketplace built *by* collectors, *for* collectors. We are launching soon to take on the giants (and their 13% fees), but we need your help to start the engine.

**Why list with us?**
*   **0% Seller Fees** for Founding Sellers (first 3 months).
*   **Free AI Grading:** Scan your raw cards and get an instant condition estimate.
*   **DealSafe Escrow:** Sell to interstate buyers without the risk of chargebacks or "item not received" scams.

We are inviting a hand-picked group of 50 top Australian collectors to seed the marketplace before we open the doors to the public.

Cheers,

**The Picksy Team**
