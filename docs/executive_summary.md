# Picksy Executive Summary

## What is Picksy?
Picksy is a **premier, trust-first marketplace specialized for collectors**, initially launching in Australia. It aims to solve the fragmentation and lack of trust found in generic platforms (like Facebook Marketplace or Gumtree) by providing a dedicated, feature-rich home for high-value collectibles.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Trust Through Verification**: A "Verified Sellers" program ensures that buyers are dealing with reputable community members.
- **AI-Powered Tools**: Built-in AI analysis for instant card grading, listing suggestions, and valuations, removing the guesswork for sellers.
- **Collector-First Experience**: Specialized categories for Collector Cards, Coins, Memorabilia, and more, with powerful filters tailored to the hobby (Condition, Year, Tiered Release timing).
- **Indie Spirit**: Built as a high-performance, modern web application (Next.js, Firebase) that prioritizes speed and SEO.

## Target Market
- **Sellers**: Professional collectors, hobby shops, and individuals looking for a professional storefront without the high fees of eBay.
- **Buyers**: Collectors looking for vetted items, "Featured" priority finds, and a secure transaction environment.

## Strategic Vision
Picksy is more than a list of items; it's a **community utility**. Features like the "Price Assistant" and "Keep Lists" transform the marketplace into a research and management tool, driving recurring engagement even between purchases.
