# SEO Structure Guidelines

## URL Structure
- Guides must live under `/guide/[slug]`.
- Slugs must be kebab-case, lowercase, and keyword-rich (e.g., `1986-fleer-jordan`).

## Metadata
- **Title**: Must include "Guide", "Value", or "Investment" + Key Topic.
- **Description**: Must be < 160 characters and include a call-to-action ("Check live prices...").

## Heading Hierarchy
- **H1**: The main topic. One per page.
- **H2**: Major sections (History, Value, Checklist).
- **H3**: Specific cards or items.

## Internal Linking
- Every guide must link to:
    1. The `/browse` page filtered for that category.
    2. The `/sell` page with a CTA.
    3. At least 2 other related guides.
